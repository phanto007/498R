Created five different sets of entry categories for the most popular forex pairs. Open High Low Close and Volume (OHLCV) data was crawled from online sources for those pairs. This was then filtered using multiple indicators to find out profitable entry conditions which was used for training with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models. Research results show that LSTM outperforms them all.
